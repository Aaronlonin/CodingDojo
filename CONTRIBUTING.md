# Contributing to the Code Connector Website

There are a few things to know before getting started contributing to this repository. Before getting into it, we'd like to thank you for your interest and let you know that we love contributions of any size and are here to support and welcome first time contributors!

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code Connector Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [codeconnectorteam@gmail.com](mailto:codeconnectorteam@gmail.com).

## How can one contribute?

### Submit Challenges

Challenges can be submitted as issues on this repository. We will attempt to use voting on these issues as a method of prioritizing challenges for their selection.

### Attend the Meetup

During the meetup we will practice mob/group programming where we encourage a newer/learning developer to take the wheel as we work together to create a solution to the challenge in whatever language is chose. 

### Submit Solutions

Solutions can be in whatever language you would like. Just because a challenge has a submitted solution does not mean that you can't contribute. We enjoy seeing how different people implement different solutions.

In order to submit a solution you will need to fork this repository, commit your changes into your fork, and then open a pull request (PR) to the main repository.  At this point we will get a code reviewer to walk through the solution with you and make sure that everything is in order before merging to the main project.
